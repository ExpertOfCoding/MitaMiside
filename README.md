Mita's Heart - A Fun Interactive Python Project

This project is a simple Python application that allows users to interact with an anime character named Mita. Clicking on Mita's image makes a heart appear and float upwards with a slight wobble.

Features:

Click Interaction: Clicking on Mita's image triggers a heart animation.
Heart Animation: A heart image appears and floats upwards with a slight horizontal oscillation.
Customizable Images: You can easily replace the "image.png" and "kalp.png" files with your own images.
Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Python 3.10.6+
PyQt5 library (installation: pip install PyQt5)
Running the Application:

Save the code snippet you provided (including imports) as a Python file (e.g., mita_heart.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the application using the following command:
python imagedisplay.py

Customization
Image Replacement:
Replace the "image.png" file with your desired image for Mita.
Replace the "kalp.png" file with your desired image for the heart.
Animation Adjustments:
You can modify the code within the show_floating_image function to adjust the animation behavior. For example, you can change the duration, movement pattern, or opacity fade of the heart.
